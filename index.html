      <h3>An Introduction to Keith</h3>
        <p>
        Keith was raised in a small town in Nebraska to two hard-working parents. He watched his parents work for everything that they have, and this instilled a drive in him to work for his accomplishments in life. He is always staying busy and challenging himself. His father enjoyed restoring cars and often times involved Keith in his projects. This helped inspire his mechanical and analytical thinking. Keith now enjoys understanding how things work and using his understanding to build and restore items.
